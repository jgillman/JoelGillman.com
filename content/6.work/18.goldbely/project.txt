content: Worked with Goldbely's talented co-founder, [Vanessa Torrivilla](http://www.imabadidea.com/), on an interactive experience designed to give users an sneak peek at the upcoming site.

Goldbely is a curated marketplace of outlandishly delicious, incredible, edible gourmet gifts.

For this project I used [@Prinzhorn](http://twitter.com/Prinzhorn)'s parallax scrolling library [Skrollr](//github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr). (It's great!)
