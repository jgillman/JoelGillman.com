Joel Gillman, born in Milwaukee, WI; moved to Madison, WI; attended college in Minneapolis, MN and currently resides in Manhattan, NY. Clearly he is afraid to live in a city whose name does not start with the letter *M*. Joel loves making art installations (interactive by nature), beautiful interactive programs and also loves working on film productions. In 2008 he landed an awesome BFA in Interactive Media from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design.
