title: Your website sucks and I hate your design!
---

From time to time my company gets emails that go something like this:

> Your web site is awful! and I hate it. I could not place an order because it
> was so dumb. You have lost me as a customer.

Luckily we don't get these kinds of emails very often, so when we do I like to
take a few minutes out of my day to respond sincerely. Deep down, I know
they're probably a troll, but I like to give them a chance and I treat them
like an adult.

I had a lecture class in school with a really great teacher. There was a
student who thought they knew better than the teacher and was always trying to
make comments and critiques on how they were teaching. Eventually the teacher
said "next week, you should prepare some materials and *you* can lecture the
class". The next week came and the student was horribly prepared and only made
it 10 minutes into the "lecture" before they ran out of material realizing that
giving a lecture was much more difficult than it had appeared.

In my three years of responding to these troll emails I've only had one person
actually respond with real feedback. And that one person had some good ideas
and we incorporated into our design and experience!
