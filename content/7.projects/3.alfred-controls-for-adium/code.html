<p>A set of AppleScripts so you can set your chat status from <a href="http://alfredapp.com/">Alfred App</a>. Remember, you will need Alfred and the <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/">Powerpack</a> to use this.</p>

<p>Adium Controls for Alfred makes it super easy to set an away message and start your screen saver. Personally I have my computer lock when the screen saver goes up so it quickly secures my computer as I walk away. It's perfect for letting other people know if you'll be back in a minute (brb) or back in an hour (lunch).</p>

<p>Source, downloads and full readme is up on GitHub.</p>
