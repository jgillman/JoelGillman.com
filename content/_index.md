# Hey there! I'm Joel.

I'm a co-founder of Goldbelly and currently serving the role of Engineering
Manager, guiding the infrastructure team and focused on building systems that
scale. I now live in Saint Paul, MN with my wife and daughter, spending my time
being a dad, making music, and tinkering with home automation projects.
