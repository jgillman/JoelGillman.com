Coded emails with HTML and CSS so they avoid the largest number of spam filters
and display correctly in the majority of email clients.

Many people assume coding emails is the same as coding a website. Unfortunately
this is not completely true as divs are largely unrecognized by many emails
clients. Tables must be used.
