Hey there! I'm Joel.

I'm an Engineering Manager at Goldbelly where I've been a co-founder since 2013, currently leading the infrastructure team and focused on building systems that scale. I now live in Saint Paul, MN with my wife and daughter, spending my time being a dad, making music, and tinkering with home automation projects.
