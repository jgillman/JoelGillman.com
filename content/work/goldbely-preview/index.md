Worked with Goldbely's talented co-founder, [Vanessa Torrivilla][], on an
interactive experience designed to give users an sneak peek at the upcoming

Goldbely is a curated marketplace of outlandishly delicious, incredible, edible
gourmet gifts.

For this project I used [@Prinzhorn][]'s parallax scrolling library
[Skrollr][]. (It's great!)

The beautiful main site is now live, but you can still see the landing page
