I don't normally get fan mail but, much to my surprise, I get fan mail about
Deeqs. I wasn't the target audience but it apparently holds a lot of nostalgia
and good memories for a lot of people. Unfortunately, other than what you see
on the site here, I don't have any of the original files.

Please keep sending me your fan art! I genuinely love seeing it.
