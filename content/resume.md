Co-founder and Cloud Engineering Manager *January 2013 – Present*

Technology: JavaScript, BEM-style CSS (via Sass), HTML (via Haml), Ruby, Node

After working with [Vanessa][] at Blip and loving it, she tore
me away to help co-found [Goldbelly.com][] so we could find the best food across
the country and deliver it to everyone.

Over the first year I completely rewrote 90%+ of the front end code and
JavaScript.  As a co-founder I've done a bit of everything and worn nearly
every hat. From managing user accounts on servers, to running social media
campaigns, optimising SEO, fund raising a seed round, and so on.
