Joel Gillman, born in Milwaukee, WI; moved to Madison, WI; then Minneapolis, MN and currently resides in Manhattan, NY. Clearly he is afraid to live in a city that does not start with **M**.

In 2008 he landed an awesome BFA in Interactive Media from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. Promptly starting as a nerdy designer gave him unique perspective when he surrendered to front-end/UI development.

Pragmatic, personable and facetious, he is a delight to work with *(if I may be so bold)*.
