<p><strong>Updated for the new SoundCloud design!</strong></p>

<p>Simply drag the link below into your bookmarks bar on your browser. Then, on any SoundCloud page, click it to disable all comments.</p>

<p><a href="javascript:(function()%7B%24(%22%3Cstyle%20type%3D'text%2Fcss'%3E%20.commentBubble%2C%20.commentPlaceholder%7Bdisplay%3Anone%20!important%3B%7D%20%3C%2Fstyle%3E%22).appendTo(%22head%22)%7D)()">&#9729; Disable Comments</a></p>

<p><em>By the way,</em> this isn't meant to be a jab at SoundCloud. I love them and think that have a fantastic site and product. I'm just antisocial :)</p>
