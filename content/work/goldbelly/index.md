My role has evolved from writing the initial code to leading engineering teams and infrastructure. I focus on building reliable systems that can scale with our growth while keeping the human element central to how we work.

Some areas where I've contributed:
- Led infrastructure and platform teams through multiple scaling challenges
- Helped establish engineering practices that balance technical debt with feature velocity
- Built tools and processes that let smaller teams move quickly without breaking things
- Worked across the organization to align technical decisions with business needs

I tend to make pragmatic technical decisions, especially when information is incomplete. My approach is to start moving in a direction that can be course-corrected rather than trying to plan for every scenario upfront.

Maybe this part should be a blog post but people always ask so:

It’s now been 13 years since [my coworker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessatorrivilla/) at [Blip](/work/blip/) said to me “hey, do you want to quit your well paying job and move across the country to build a company with two other guys you don’t really know yet?“ After meeting [Joe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeariel/) for coffee and then later getting a late-night tour of the codebase from [Trevor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-stow-6984394/) in an empty and dark WeWork (in a language I had never professionally used) I decided “yes, if anyone is going to give this and honest shot it’s gonna be these guys.” A couple weeks later I was on a plane to Silicon Valley.
