title: About
---
Joel Gillman is an Engineering Manager at Goldbelly, where he's been a
co-founder since 2013. Originally from Milwaukee, he's lived in Madison,
Minneapolis, and New York before settling in Saint Paul, MN with his wife and
daughter.

At Goldbelly, Joel has worn many hats over the yearsâ€”from VP of Engineering to
his current role managing the infrastructure team. While he earned his BFA in
Interactive Media and still enjoys UI/front-end work on the side, these days
he's focused on leading people and building systems that scale.

When he's not working, Joel's main focus is being a dad, which he absolutely
loves. In his spare time, you'll find him making music, tinkering with his home
server and automation projects, or trying to squeeze in some reading before bed
(his goal is at least one page a night, though it usually turns into more). He
still enjoys video games when time allows, though that's become a bit more rare
these days.

Joel brings a pragmatic and personable approach to everything he does, whether
that's building teams, solving technical challenges, or just having a good
conversation.
