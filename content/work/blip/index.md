Worked with some of the best designers and developers I've ever worked with to
create a platform focused on delivering the best original web series to
viewers.

Where possible, all CSS (no JS) solutions were used to create complex user
interactions. The best examples of this are on the show posters and episode
thumbnails *(see videos)*.
