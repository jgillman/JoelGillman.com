Created a novel backend search/cache system with Senior Backend Developer and
build out all HTML and jQuery. Reproduced most art work for web and designed
suggestion box.

This site was completely built in two weeks and was probably the most
high-pressure fun I&rsquo;ve had working on a project.

*This site is, unfortunately, no longer live.*
